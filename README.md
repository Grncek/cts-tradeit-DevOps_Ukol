I got 2 script one for Google chrome that use ChromeDrive that must be downloaded. Second use microsoft edge webdriver-manager. 

Before executing Main_EDGE:
1) Install Selenium: pip install selenium
2) Install webdriver-manager: pip install webdriver-manager



Before executing Main_CHROME:
1) The script utilize Selenium library so you must install Selenium: pip install selenium
2) Selenium does not work without driver so its essential to put your drive in path "C:\Program Files (x86)\chromedriver"
3) Download ChromeDriver here: https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/downloads?authuser=0
   if you have newer version of Chrome here: https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/
